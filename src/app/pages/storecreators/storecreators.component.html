        <h3 class="processes-title">Laser Cutting</h3>
        <p>Laser Cutting is the process of a laser beam cutting through steel in extremely precise accuracy and speed.
          Typically found in large-scale industrial manufacturing facilities, it is the method of choice to cut complex
          or
          simple pieces out of sheet metal. Leftovers are minimal making it particularly efficient.</p>
        <p>Given its precision, it can not only boost your product quality, but also allow for elements that would
          otherwise be impossible with regular machines.</p>
